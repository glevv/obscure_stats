## Highlights:

`obscure_stats` is a small Python package that includes a lot of useful but lesser-known statistical functions and builds on top of `numpy` and `scipy`.

## Installation

```bash
>>> pip install obscure_stats
```

## Usage Example

```python
>>> from obscure_stats.central_tendency import standard_trimmed_harrell_davis_quantile
>>> from obscure_stats.dispersion import standard_quantile_absolute_deviation

>>> data = [1.83, 1.01, 100.12, 1.20, 0.99, 0.87, 1.13, 100.01, 0.75, 1.03]
>>> central_tendency = standard_trimmed_harrell_davis_quantile(data)
>>> dispersion = standard_quantile_absolute_deviation(data)
>>> print(f"Robust measure of central tendency = {central_tendency:.2f}±{dispersion:.2f}")
```

```
Out[1]:
Robust measure of central tendency = 1.09±0.42
```
